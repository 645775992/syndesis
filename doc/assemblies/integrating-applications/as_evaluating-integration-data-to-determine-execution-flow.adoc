= Evaluating integration data to determine the execution flow
:context: condition

In a flow, a *Conditional Flows* step evaluates integration data 
against conditions that you specify. For each specified condition, 
you add connections and other steps to the flow associated with 
that condition. During execution, a *Conditional Flows* step 
evaluates incoming data to determine which flow to execute.
