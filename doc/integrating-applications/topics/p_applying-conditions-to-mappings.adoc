= Applying conditions to mappings

In some integrations, it is helpful to add conditional 
processing to a mapping. For example, suppose that you are 
mapping a source zip code field to a target zip code field. 
If the source zip code field is empty, you want to fill 
the target field with `99999`.

You can define zero or one condition for each mapping. 

.Prerequisites

* You are mapping fields in a *Data Mapper* step. 
* You are familiar with Microsoft Excel expressions or 
you have the conditional expression that you want to apply 
to a mapping. 

.Procedure

. Create the mapping that you want to apply a condition to, or
ensure that the currently selected mapping is the mapping that you 
want to apply a condition to. 

. In the upper right, click

display the conditional expression input field.

The data mapper automatically displays the name of the first
source field in the expression field. 

. Specify a Microsoft Excel expression in the input field.
