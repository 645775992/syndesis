# Bindings will be applied by the operator (syndesis-operator account)
# to allow the operand service accounts these privileges. This occurs
# during the install of the operands.
#
# In order for this to succeed, the operator's service account must have
# the same privileges hence it is bound to the requisite cluster roles
# during the "grant" command or given the privileges by the CSV during
# the OLM install.

# Must be a ClusterRoleBinding as the syndesis-server service account
# wants to list kafkas across namespaces
#
# Note.
# A RoleBinding binding to a ClusterRole will only
# allow the permissions at the namespace-scope level
