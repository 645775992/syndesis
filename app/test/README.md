# Syndesis Testing

This repository contains integrated e2e tests for Syndesis.

## System Tests

These system tests are meant to be run against Openshift _(either within or pointing to an Openshift installation)_ and perform
a full installation of Syndesis in that environment.

Read the [documentation](system-test) for details.
